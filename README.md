# How to start the battleships

This is a fork of Tonis very nice example to copmare React and Vuejs. I've fixed some dings and dongs espacially in the VueJs example to make it work with the current version of VueJs. I've also added _eslint_.

By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.
